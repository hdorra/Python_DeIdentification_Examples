# Data De-Identification with Python Libraries (Faker and Mimesis)

This repository contains example Python codes for de-identifying sensitive information in a dataset using two popular Python libraries: Faker and Mimesis.

## Why De-Identification is Important

De-identification is an important step in data privacy and security. By removing or replacing sensitive information such as names, addresses, and email addresses, we can prevent the potential misuse or exposure of personal data. This is especially important in fields such as healthcare, finance, and marketing where large amounts of personal data are collected and processed.

## Using Faker and Mimesis Libraries

The Faker and Mimesis libraries offer a convenient and efficient way to de-identify data using Python. These libraries contain a variety of providers that generate realistic fake data for names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and more.

## Supported Attributes for De-Identification

The following attributes can be de-identified using Faker and Mimesis libraries:

* Name
* Email
* Address
* Phone Number
* Date of Birth
* Credit Card Number
* Job Title
* Company Name
* Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
* And many more!

For a complete list of supported providers and attributes, refer to the [Faker documentation](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/providers.html) and [Mimesis documentation](https://mimesis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/providers.html).
